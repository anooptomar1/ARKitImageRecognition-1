# AR Kit Image Recognition Demo

## Intro 
This repository contains a simple ARkit demo that detects images and places videos and 3D Objects. To create this demo i used and modifed a project made Jayven N. from AppCoda (https://appcoda.com/arkit-image-recognition/). Check out his post about image recognition since it's the base of this demo. 
Feel free to use this example to create some new awsome apps :)
